      <description>Covid is a dreadful infection which is hard to detect. So, we have tried to design a model which can predict Covid from CT scans. This assist radiologist and make their process much easier. The dataset was collected from various sources such as a open sourced github repo and from some hospitals. Since the data collected is pretty less, we have a model, BCD-Unet for segmentation of lungs on open sourced lung dataset in kaggle.</description>
